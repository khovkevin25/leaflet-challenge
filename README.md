## Kevin Khov

In this challenge, we were tasked to visualize earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Here, data is collected every single day on earthquakes, such as depth, magnitude and location of earthquakes over a course of time. However, the USGS does not have a meaningful way of displaying said data. Using HTML and JavaScript, I was able to create a dynamic visualization of all USGS earthquake data over the past 7 days that shows location, magnitude, and depth of each earthquake.

The visualization of USGS earthquake data can be found in the file "index.html". Here, a map of Earth and earthquakes can be found, drilling down to individual earthquake data by clicking on any of the circles on the map that represent an earthquake. The JavaScript code used to create this visualization can be found under the "static" -> "js" folders in the file "logic.js". Images used to create the visualization can be found in the "Images" folder. Formatting of the webpage in the HTML can be found in the "css" folder under "style.css".
